. All of the codes logics are being implemented by myself and algorithms are searched online (Google) and then the help is taken from the AI (Chatgpt and Claude) to remove bugs from the code then those cases are verified using different examples.

. Codes are in well structured form and are with proper foldering.

. Documentation credit goes to Claude ai.
	  Prompts were my codes and the request to create a README.md of those codes.
	  Also commenting is done using AI.
	  
. Some of the logic are being conceptually taken from my friends.
