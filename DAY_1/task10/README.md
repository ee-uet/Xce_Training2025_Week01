# Task 0.10 â€“ Command Line Arguments (Sum of Two Integers)

## Problem
- Write a program that takes **two integers** as command-line arguments.  
- Convert them from string to integer using `atoi()`.  
- Print the sum of the two integers.  

---

## Approach
1. Use `argc` and `argv[]` to access command-line arguments.  
2. Convert `argv[1]` and `argv[2]` from strings to integers using `atoi()`.  
3. Compute the sum.  
4. Print the result.  

---

## How to Run
1. Save the code in a file, `task_10.c`.  
2. Compile the program:  
   ```bash
    gcc task_10.c -o task_10
    ./task10 5 10

## Example Output
./task10 20 30
Sum = 50

## Known Limitations

Program assumes exactly two arguments are provided. If fewer/more are passed, it may cause errors.

No validation for non-numeric input (e.g., ./task10 a b will give undefined behavior).

To handle these gracefully, argument count and validation checks should be added.
