# Week-01 Labs: Productivity Tools & C Fundamentals
Welcome to **Week-01 Labs**  
This repository is for submitting your deliverables for **Week-01** of the Digital Design Training Program.  
During this week, you explored **C programming, Linux productivity tools, Git workflows, and RISC-V basics**.  
This repo will collect your lab assignments, scripts, and code implementations.

## Acknowledgment
I have used AI assistance in the following aspects of this project:
- **Documentation**: Creating comprehensive README.md files for better project organization and understanding
- **Algorithm Understanding**: Understanding complex algorithms such as Booth's multiplication algorithm etc
- **Debugging Support**: Assistance in debugging code when I was unable to resolve issues independently
