# Week-01 Labs: Productivity Tools & C Fundamentals

Welcome to **Week-01 Labs**  
This repository is for submitting your deliverables for **Week-01** of the Digital Design Training Program.  

During this week, you explored **C programming, Linux productivity tools, Git workflows, and RISC-V basics**.  
This repo will collect your lab assignments, scripts, and code implementations.
