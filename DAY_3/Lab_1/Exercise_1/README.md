# Hello World Bash Script

## Problem
The task is to write a simple Bash script that prints `"Hello, World!"` to the terminal.  
This is often the first program used to test whether the programming environment is set up correctly.

## Approach
- Use the Bash `echo` command to print text to the terminal.  
- The script starts with a **shebang (`#!/bin/bash`)** to indicate it should run in the Bash shell.  

## How to Run
1. Save the script as `hello.sh`.  
2. Make it executable:  
   ```bash
   chmod +x E1_1.sh
    ./E1_1.sh

## Examples

Running the script will output:

 ./hello.sh
Hello, World!

## Known Limitations

The script only prints a fixed string "Hello, World!".

It does not take any arguments or provide dynamic output.

Requires Bash shell (/bin/bash) to be installed on the system.
