# Day 1 – C Language Experiments  

This directory contains my **Day 1 experiments in C programming**, covering basics like data types, operators, control structures, recursion, file handling, bitwise operations, enums, structs, and command-line arguments.  

## Contents  

All tasks are implemented in a **single C file**. You can comment/uncomment function calls in `main()` to run a specific task.  

### Implemented Tasks  

1. **Data Types & Type Casting** – Print sizes of types and demonstrate type casting.  
2. **Calculator** – Basic calculator using `switch-case`.  
3. **Fibonacci Sequence** – Generate Fibonacci numbers.  
4. **Guessing Game** – Random number guessing with hints.  
5. **Prime Numbers (1–100)** – Print all primes between 1 and 100.  
6. **Factorial (Recursion)** – Recursive factorial function.  
7. **Reverse String** – Reverse user input string.  
8. **Second Largest Element in Array** – Find second largest element.  
9. **File I/O** – Write and read integers from a file.  
10. **Bitwise Operators** – AND, OR, XOR, NOT, shifts.  
11. **Check Power of 2** – Using bitwise trick `n & (n-1)`.  
12. **Enum – Days of Week** – Map number to weekday.  
13. **Struct – Euclidean Distance** – Calculate distance between two points.  
14. **Command-Line Arguments** – Sum two integers passed via command line.
