# Week 01: Covered Topics

This week focused on building strong foundations in C programming, shell scripting, and RISC-V assembly. The aim was to revise core concepts, practice problem-solving, and gain hands-on experience with productivity tools like git, vim , bash and makefile. Productivity tools are essential for working as a professional.
