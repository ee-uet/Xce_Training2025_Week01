# C Program: Simple Calculator

## Overview
This program demonstrates:
- Performing basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`) on two integers
- Printing results directly
- Implementing a **switch-case calculator** that takes user input for the operation

##  Code Structure
- **`task02_calculator()`**
  - Declares two integers (`a = 3`, `b = 4`)
  - Performs all arithmetic operations on them
  - Asks the user to enter an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`)
  - Executes the corresponding case using a `switch` statement
- **`main()`**
  - Calls the calculator function
