## Test Cases

Normal addition
Input: a = 10, b = 5, operator = +
Expected: Result of 10 + 5 = 15

Division with non-zero divisor
Input: a = 20, b = 4, operator = /
Expected: Result of 20 / 4 = 5

Division by zero
Input: a = 8, b = 0, operator = /
Expected: Division by zero is not allowed

Modulo with non-zero divisor
Input: a = 9, b = 2, operator = %
Expected: Result of 9 % 2 = 1

Invalid operator
Input: a = 6, b = 3, operator = ^
Expected: Invalid Operator!
