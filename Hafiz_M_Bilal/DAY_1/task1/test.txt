## Test Cases

Default values
Input: i = 42, f = 3.14, d = 1.23456, c = 'A'
Expected: Correct values printed with sizes and type casting results.

Change values
Input: i = 100, f = 7.77, d = 123.456, c = 'z'
Expected: Values and sizes updated accordingly, type casting shows truncated results for float/double to int.

Edge case with char
Input: c = 127 (max value for signed char)
Expected: Printing as integer should show 127.
