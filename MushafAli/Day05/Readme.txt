Lab: Introduction to RISC-V Assembly Programming
Objective

In this lab, I learned how to write RISC-V assembly programs, run them on the Spike simulator, and use Spikeâ€™s debugging features.

What I Did

I installed the RISC-V GNU toolchain and Spike simulator on my machine.

 wrote a linker script (link.ld) to define the memory layout for my programs.

 created assembly programs in .S files and learned to use registers, loops, and branches.

 used Spike to run my programs and debug them using commands like r, s, mem, and until pc.

 learned how to output messages using HTIF.

 created a Makefile to automate assembling, linking, running, and debugging my programs.


##Exercises I Completed

Calculated the absolute difference between two numbers.

Counted the number of set bits in a 32-bit word.

Calculated the factorial of a number.
