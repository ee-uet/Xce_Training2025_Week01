# Problem
Create a program that demonstrates basic pointer usage:
-	Declare an integer variable and a pointer to it
-	Print the value of the variable using both direct access and the pointer
-	Modify the value using the pointer and print the new value
#
**Approach**
- Declare an integer variable x and a pointer ptr pointing to it.

- Print the value of x using both the variable and the pointer.

- Modify the value of x through the pointer.

- Print the updated value using both the variable and the pointer to verify the change.
#
**How to run**

- Save the code in a file, for example: code.c
- Open a terminal and compile the program using GCC:    
  gcc code.c -o code
- Run the program:
    ./code
#
**Example**   
value of x = 5  
value of x using pointer = 5   
Modified value of x = 100  
Modified value of x  with pointer = 100  
#
**Resources and References**  
While implementing the pointer arithmetic, I referred to the lab slides to understand pointer usage.
