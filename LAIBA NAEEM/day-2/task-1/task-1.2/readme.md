# Problem
Implement a function that swaps two integers using pointers
#
**Approach**
- Declare two integer variables a and b.

- Pass their addresses to the swap function using pointers.

- Inside the function, use a temporary variable to exchange the values of *a and *b.

- Print the values before and after swapping to verify the change.
#
**How to run**

- Save the code in a file, for example: code.c
- Open a terminal and compile the program using GCC:    
  gcc code.c -o code
- Run the program:
    ./code
#
**Example**   
value of a before swapping = 5
value of b before swapping = 10
value of a after swapping = 10
value of b after swapping = 5

**Resources and References**  
While implementing the pointer arithmetic, I referred to the lab slides to understand pointer usage.
